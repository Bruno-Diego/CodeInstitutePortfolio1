                    <p>Hi! My name is Bruno Diego da Silva, I'm a software developer aspiring to be
                        expert in Javascript and currently living in Dublin, Republic of Ireland!
                        I also love playing guittar and video games. Coffee is fuel and the stronger the better.
                        I'm currently working at Amazon Web Services as a Data Center Technician and studying to become
                        a
                        full-stack developer at Code Institute.
                        By the way, this website was made to be submitted as Portfolio Project as part of the
                        requirements
                        to acieve the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course.
                        I appreciate your visit and if you eant to know more about me please send an e-mail to
                        bruno.diego.x@hotmail.com and I will respond as soon as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Coding specs:</b>
                        This website was built with only semantic HTML5 and CSS3. Preprocessors like Sass or HAML, and
                        CSS
                        libraries like Bootstrap were not used because my intent on the project was to show how
                        appreciate I
                        am with the knowledge provided by the course at this point.
                        I had the opportunity to use a few external resources like Google Fonts (for Source Sans Pro and
                        Poppins), Font Awesome for social media icons, embedded iframes from Youtube and some pictures
                        from
                        Pexels, which were all Creative Commons and free for non-profit use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have availed of many resources around the web to help me learn. The following is far from a
                        complete list, but it covers those which were most important for me:
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5656369/john">Stack Overflow</a>,
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a>,
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS_TRICKS</a>,
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>,
                        and also the channels at Code Institute's workspace at <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The layout was first immagined and wireframmed on Balsamiq Wireframes with the licence provided
                        by Code Institute and built to bring calm and pattern-feeling to the user.
                        It has a intuitive structure with the navigation bar at the top, footer at the bottom and the
                        content on the area in between. The styling is consistent through all pages. Links are styled to
                        be underlined when selected and when hovered upon, also the external links open in a new tab.
                        The main navigation links also have a distinct color to catch the user's attention and to
                        encourage to click them!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The footer contains icons for Facebook, Instagram, Github and LinkedIn, which link as expected
                        to my accounts on the respective platforms.
                        The website is fully responsive and can be accessed
                        on many different screens and compatiple with the most used browsers.
                    </p>
