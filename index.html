                    <!-- created a paragraph explaining whats the purpose of the website and the object -->
                    <p>This website approach a lifestyle based on the concepts of the ancient chinese philosophy around
                        Yin
                        and
                        Yang. It is a concept of life-balance and dualism to reach harmony and inner peace. It brings to
                        us
                        the
                        idea that everything in the universe has two opposite sides that complement each other. As an
                        universal
                        concept it can be applied to our own lifes and how we see life itself.
