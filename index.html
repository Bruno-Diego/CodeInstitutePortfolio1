                    <p>This website approach a lifestyle based on the concepts of the ancient chinese philosophy around
                        Yin
                        and
                        Yang. It is a concept of life-balance and dualism to reach harmony and inner peace. It brings to
                        us
                        the
                        idea that everything in the universe has two opposite sides that complement each other.

                            <h2>More Than Lifestyle</h2>
                            <p><strong>Yin and Yang</strong> is a Chinese philosophical concept that describes how
                                obviously
                                opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and
                                interdependent in
                                the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one
                                another.[1] In Chinese cosmology, the
                                universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the
                                cycles of
                                Yin and
                                Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active
                                principle, seen
                                in
                                all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the
                                landscape
                                (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the
                                formation
                                of both men and women as characters and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).

                                Yin and Yang represent opposite sides in balance. In today's world we are often
                                inundated with
                                information and pressured to exaggerate our actions to achieve our goals. However, Yin
                                and Yiang
                                is about having a balanced life. Yin refers to Contemplation, Contraction, Softness,
                                Stillness,
                                Quiet; and Yang is related to Action, Expansion, Growth, Heat and Movement. It means
                                that in
                                order to live in harmony and achieve your goals, it is necessary to maintain a balance
                                between
                                extremes. Not to let one overlap the other, but to allow them to coexist. Visit our
