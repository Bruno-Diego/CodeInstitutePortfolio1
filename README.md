# Yin-Yang Website

## Welcome fellow visitor,

This is the Code Institute Portfolio 1 Project for submission.

For better UI/UX we used a modern and simple interface with a well defined navigation bar, spaced letters with a good contrast for a cool reading and colors based on a bamboo pallette unifomized in the entire website.

At the Home page, the main area contains a spinning YinYang made with pure CSS took from CodePen.io with credits to @AdamSSenniN who create it.
