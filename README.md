  - Helpful guidance to have a balanced lifestyle.

The user interested on the presented ideas can start on the home page with the presentation text explaining the purpose of the website and information about it. Users that wish to have a deeper understanding about the subject can check the resources page that is filled with videos and audios to watch and listen on meditating or relaxing momments. It´s also possible to find links that lead to different websites with valued materials related to the idea presented. At last, there´s a Contact page with the specifications about the website and information of contact with the creator.

The following features will be included in this release:

  - Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page.
  - Resources page with calming videos, sounds and links for external websites.
  - Information and recommendations for having a balanced lifestyle.
  - Newsletter sign up form.
  - Links to social media pages.

This website was crafted using only semantic HTML5 and CSS3. It was created to give birth to the first "Portfolio Project" to complete as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course at Code Institute in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. 

For better UI/UX, a modern and simple interface is used with a well defined navigation bar, spaced letters with a good contrast for a cool reading and colors based on a bamboo pallette uniformized in the entire website.

The layout has a intuitive structure with the navigation bar at the top, footer at the bottom and the content on the area in between. The styling is consistent through all pages. Links are styled to be underlined when selected and when hovered upon, also the external links open in a new tab. The main navigation links also have a distinct color to catch the user's attention and to encourage to click them.

The footer contains icons for Facebook, Instagram, Github and LinkedIn, which link as expected to the creators accounts on the respective platforms. The website is fully responsive and can be accessed on many different screens and compatiple with the most used browsers.

## Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

## Via Gitpod

The project deployment was based on the [Code Institute Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

  - Click the `Use This Template` button.
  - Add a repository name and brief description.
  - Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
  - To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
  - When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than create a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.
  -  Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    - `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

  1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
  2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
  3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

  1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
  2. Press the arrow on the Code button
  3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
  4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
  5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
  6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.

## Via Github Pages

  - The live website was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  
    1. Log in to GitHub
    2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
    3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click `Settings`
    4. Select `Pages` on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
    5. In the source section, select branch `Master` and save
    6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:
